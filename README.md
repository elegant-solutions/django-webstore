# What is this Django Webstore?

This webstore was built with Python, Django, and jQuery, and deployed via Heroku. It was developed by Keith Brandtjen, Britt Johnson, and Rachael Wisecarver. We are using Django REST Framework for our API.

## Testing the Braintree API via Our Site

We are currently using a sandbox account with our Braintree API, so we don't take actual credit cards as
we are still testing and improving this project. To see how the payments work, use this test credit card information:

- Credit Card: 4111 1111 1111 1111
- Expiration Date: 11/19

## Features

- Production-ready configuration for Static Files, Database Settings, Gunicorn, etc.
- Enhancements to Django's static file serving functionality via WhiteNoise
- Search functionality using Django's Q Lookup
- Prototype-level user login and registration using Django Registration Redux
- A fully functional admin page that allows the store owner/admins to add, delete, and modify product offerings
- Dynamic content loaded using Django templates
- Persistence maintained using a PostgreSQL Database
- Key features loaded asynchronously using Ajax
- RESTful framework implemented using Django routing
- Responsive, mobile-first design
- A fully functional order form. Once the user adds items to their cart, they should be able to proceed to an order form where they can review and modify their order, if need be, add their billing and shipping address, and process their payment using the Braintree API.
- *Deployed using Heroku, thanks to Britt's incredibly hard work and with help from Rick, Chris, and Munir.*

## Future Development

In time, we will implement the following features:

- A fully functional login and registration feature, with full email and password authentication and email marketing capabilities
- The user would then receive an email confirmation of their order status.
- More developed styling so that the page both looks and functions like a real-world e-commerce site.
- Adding/improving analytics, testing, SEO, and speed/optimization
- A chat feature, so that if a user has been browsing products for X amount of time, a chat box would open up asking if they have any questions that can be answered by either a store employee or by a bot.
